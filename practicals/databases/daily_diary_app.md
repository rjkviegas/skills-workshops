Daily Diary Application

Mini project exploring how databases work.

## Description

I enjoy keeping a journal, and I want to store this online in my very own 'Daily Diary' application.

As a busy coach I'm a bit short on time, so I've provided user stories below so you can build one for me. Your challenge is to build a 'Daily Diary' application that uses Sinatra together with a PostgreSQL to store diary entries, and has a browser-based user interface.

I've included some extra functionality options, so the user requirements are split into 'Must have', 'Should have' and 'Could have'.

If you can think if any other cool features then feel free to add them 😃

To get feedback on your approach, please share your work with a Coach together with a reflection on:

- What has gone well in this project
- What could have gone better
- Any questions you have
- What you want feedback on, and why

## Additional Guidance

- This mini project should be used to help you reflect on your learnings.
- You should remember to test-drive your development, and use the Object Oriented Design principles you have learnt so far.
- Don't forget that your project will need a good README, including:
 - instructions for setting up the databases, including table setup steps.
 - instructions for how to run tests
 - instructions for running the application
 - overview of your approach and design
