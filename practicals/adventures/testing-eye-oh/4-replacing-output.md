## 4. Replacing Output

### Learning Objectives
- [ ] Explain that ruby has a `StringIO` object that can be used as a pseudo IO object

### Intro

Let's use `StringIO`. If we assign the `$stdout` variable the value of a `StringIO` instance, we can then write to it using `#puts`.

```ruby
# in pry
> replacement_output = StringIO.new
=> #<StringIO:0x00007fbc80276868>
> $stdout = replacement_output
=> #<StringIO:0x00007fbc80276868>

```

Then try the following, either

```ruby
> puts 'Hi, Pair Partner!'  # remember that #puts is called implicitly on the default value stored in $stdout
```

or explicitly either:

```ruby
replacement_output.puts 'Hi, Pair Partner!'
# or
$stdout.puts 'Hi, Pair Partner!'
```

Where's the output gone?!

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Discuss with your partner what you observe
- [ ] Find where the string has been stored
- [ ] Using pry, see what exactly has been stored and discuss what you see
