## Learn to

* Learn about something by playing with a toy version

## Introduction

In [Servers 1](https://hackmd.io/KzDGBYA4BMDNgLQFNzXA8BOADLBAjScbBSfTUUba7ANgHZgg) we played around with a toy server. We used the terminal command `telnet` to connect to it. `telnet` was our client.

We're going to build our own client today.

## Exercise 1

Here's our server for today:

```ruby
require 'socket'

server = TCPServer.new(2345)

socket = server.accept

socket.puts "HELLO CLIENT WHAT IS YOUR NAME?"
name = socket.gets.chomp
socket.puts "THAT'S A LOVELY NAME #{name}"

socket.close
```

And here's our client:

```ruby
require 'socket'

socket = TCPSocket.new('localhost', 2345)

puts socket.gets
puts "Wow what a rude server... I'm going to say Sarah"
socket.puts "Sarah"
puts socket.gets

socket.close
```

Get the server running. Then in another terminal window, run the client.

You should see something like this:

```
$ ruby client.rb
HELLO CLIENT WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
Wow what a rude server... I'm going to say Sarah
THAT'S A LOVELY NAME Sarah
```

## Exercise 2

Try the following challenges, in any order you like:

1. Get the client and server talking to each other forever (or until you terminate them).
2. Use the client on one person's laptop to connect to the server on another person's laptop.

Or anything you like! What do you want to know about how these things work together? How can you play around with these examples to find out?
