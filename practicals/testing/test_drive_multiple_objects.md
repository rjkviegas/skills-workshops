# Test Drive Multiple Objects

Write the code for a supermarket checkout that can calculate the price of a number of items. Each item should be priced individually, and the checkout should be able to scan them in any order.

The requirements for the system are as follows:
```
As a shopper
So I know how much an item costs
I would like to be able to see its price
```
```
As a shopper
So that I can buy an item
I would like to be able to scan items at the checkout
```
```
As a shopper
So that I know how much to pay
I would like to be able to see a total for all scanned items
```
```
As a shopper
So that I know how much to pay
I would like to see all prices correctly formatted (£xx.xx)
```
