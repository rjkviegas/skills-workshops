# Diagramming the Rails architecture

## Instructions

### High level goal for the week

At a high level, this week is about answering yes to the question **"Can you use Rails and its conventions to build a web app?"**

In this workshop, you'll deepen your understanding of Rails's architecture.  This will help you understand Rails's conventions and predict how to use its features.

### Learning objectives

* List all the parts of the Rails architecture.
* Explain what each part does.
* Diagram how some Rails processes work.

### List all the parts of the Rails architecture (5 mins)

We'll do this as a group.

Many of the directories and standard files that `rails new` generates should appear in the list.

### Explain what each part of the Rails architecture does (10 mins)

We'll do this as a group.

### Diagram some Rails processes (30 mins)

In pairs, diagram the two processes below.  Include as much detail as you can.  Each process can be in a separate diagram.

1. Getting the RESTful index page for a model.
2. Adding a new field to a model.
3. Signing a user in via omniauth.

Don't be afraid to Google to help you understand things.  And don't be afraid to run your Yelp app and follow the flow to help you understand things.

### Plenary (15 mins)

We'll come back together for a short plenary.  Some pairs will put their diagrams on the board and we'll discuss them.
