# Composition over Inheritance

> "Prefer Composition to Inheritance"
> – Russ Olsen

A workshop that introduces composition, inheritance, and the benefits of one over the other.

## Instructions

Using the example code from the beginning of the workshop, implement the following two features:

- Implement a `Villain` class that responds to `use_power` with something like `"Galactus is now eating planets, villainously!"`
- Implement some way of having superheroes fight villains. There may be more shared behaviour to extract.
