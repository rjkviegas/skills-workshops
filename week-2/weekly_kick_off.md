# Weekly kick off - Oystercard Challenge

This week's challenge will start with going back over the basics we covered last week in Boris Bikes, giving you the chance to reinforce what you learned last week. You'll then be challenged to build a more complex system which should really stretch your skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

## Learning objectives

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you use object-oriented design principles to write better code?**

## The process you use to write code

* Break out into small groups of around four.

* Spend five minutes discussing the process you use to write code.

* E.g. test-first development.

* We'll gather back for a five minute plenary.  Groups will report back on what they discussed.

## Desirable qualities of code

* Break out into small groups of around four.

* Spend five minutes discussing what the qualities you want code to have.

* E.g. code being easy to understand.

* We'll gather back for a five minute plenary.  Groups will report back on what they discussed.

## Guidelines for writing better code

* Break out into small groups of around four.

* Spend five minutes listing and discussing guidelines that help you write better code.

* E.g. encapsulation.

* We'll gather back for a five minute plenary.  Groups will report back on what they discussed.
