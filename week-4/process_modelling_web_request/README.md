## Modelling a request

Get into groups of 5 and assign each person a role of either browser, controller, model, view or database.

Each group needs a sharpie and a sheet of paper. Trace the flow of a request by passing the sheet of paper to 
the relevant person when making a request and add on to the sheet the information you are sending.
